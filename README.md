# Database-Engine-Implementation
Database Engine involved various phases of SQL query like query parsing, validation, optimization, execution. Data Query Language queries were implemented.


Input Dataset will be :
1. csv files for tables. 

2.If a file is : File1.csv, the table name would be  File1.

3. There will be no tab-separation or space-separation, so you are not required to handle it but you have to make sure to take care of both. 


-> All the elements in files would be only INTEGERS.


-> A file named: metadata.txt(note the extension)  would be given to you which will have the following 
structure for each table:
<begin_table>
<table_name>
<attribute1>
â€¦.
<attributeN>
<end_table>
