--------------Test Suite for Assignment 1-------------------

*How to run?
- 1. Right Click on testSuite file. In the permissions tab, click on "allow executing file as a program"
- 2. Run the test suite as : ./testSuite "RollNumber"
		 Your bash-script to run your java/c++ executables should be in the same directory and should be named as your Roll Number.
- 3. The dataset is same that was sent to you earlier in the first email.
- 4. These are only a subset of queries. For the actual evaluation, we will run more queries on a different dataset.


IMPORTANT : Please don't be confused by the format of output in the suite. In the failed test cases, you will see a dictionary in expected and actual outputs. In those dictionaries, the column name is the key and corresponding list value is the ordered column. The dictionary is created by the csv output of both expected and actual results.
